flipkurl.php
============

Flipkurl is a php - curl based library to access the contents of flipkart.com site, login into it, search book listings, add books to cart, move books from to wishlist, read contents of cart, etc.
Usually shopping carts don't persist the user's selection across logins, but this one does. So whatever books you add via the library will stay in your account, so you can checkout/pay later from there.

What can it be used for ?
Custom & Personalized user interface
It can probably be used to create a mobile based interface as the site already doesn't have one.
Mashups along with API's of other sites
Automate stuff
